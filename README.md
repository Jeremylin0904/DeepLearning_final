# Final Project of Deep Learning - Advanced Course

In this project, we aim to reproduce the Siamese Masked AutoEncoder (SiamMAE) proposed in \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14344} using the PyTorch framework.
The dataset we will be pretraining our model will be UCF-101 \url{https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/papers/UCF101_CRCV-TR-12-01.pdf}. The representation learned by the model will be evaluated on an object segmentation task on DAVIS-2017 \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00675}.
